// In compile-time polymorphism, the call is resolved during compile time by the compiler.
// Some of the  forms for compile-time polymorphism are
// (1) Method/Function Overloading: more than one method/function exists with the same name but with
// different signatures or possibly different return types
// (2) Operator Overloading: the Same operator is used for operating on different data types

// Go doesnâ€™t directly support method/function/operator overloading
// but variadic function provides a way of achieving the same with increased code complexity.
